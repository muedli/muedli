<summary><h2>Buffalo-Shaped Pools</h2></summary>
I've been thinking about starting a petition to get at least five new
[buffalo-shaped pools]() built on Sko' Buffs University's Boulder campus. I
can't really think of anything else the university should be spending money
on. Let me know if you would sign such a petition.
